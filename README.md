# data_analyze


This is a data analysis project that uses Python to analyze the Boston Housing dataset. The goal of the project is to build a linear regression model that can predict the median value of owner-occupied homes based on various features, such as crime rate, number of rooms, and student-teacher ratio.

#We start by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and exploring the data using visualizations. Then, we preprocess the data by handling missing values, one-hot encoding categorical features, and standardizing the data using a scaler. Next, we split the data into training and testing sets and build a linear regression model using scikit-learn's LinearRegression class.

#We evaluate the model's performance using metrics like mean squared error and R-squared, and visualize its predictions using a scatter plot. Finally, we use the model to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes for a new neighborhood based on its features.

#Overall, this project demonstrates how Python can be used to perform data analysis and build machine learning models for real-world problems. It also showcases several important data analysis and machine learning techniques, such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation.
